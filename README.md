# Final Converter

This project is under construction and currently only converts video and audio. The idea is to eventually convert any file type to another locally, thus avoiding the need to use other systems or software.
When you run py index.py for the first time, two registry files are generated, allowing the addition of the tool to the Windows context menu.

## Windows 11

Currently, the new Windows 11 context menu is not supported, and it only works with the classic context menu.
